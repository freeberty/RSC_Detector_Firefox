# RSC Fingerprint Detector (Firefox)

A Firefox port of the [RSC Detector](https://github.com/mrknow001/RSC_Detector) Chrome extension for detecting React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js App Router fingerprints on web pages.

> **Original Extension**: This is a Firefox adaptation of the Chrome extension created by [mrknow001](https://github.com/mrknow001/RSC_Detector).

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This extension is designed for **educational and security research purposes only**. It includes functionality that could be used to test for security vulnerabilities. **Only use this extension on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized use may be illegal and unethical.

## Features

### 🔍 Passive Detection
- Automatically scans web pages for RSC indicators
- Detects Next.js App Router patterns
- Monitors page content for RSC-specific markers
- Updates extension badge when RSC is detected

### 🎯 Active Fingerprinting
- Sends controlled RSC probe requests
- Analyzes server responses for RSC characteristics
- Identifies Content-Type headers indicating RSC usage
- Detects Vary headers containing 'RSC'

### 📊 Detection Methods

The extension uses multiple detection techniques:

1. **Content-Type Analysis**: Detects `text/x-component` responses
2. **Pattern Matching**: Identifies `window.__next_f` and RSC-related patterns
3. **Header Inspection**: Analyzes Vary headers for RSC indicators
4. **Response Structure**: Checks for React Flight Protocol patterns

## Installation

### From Source
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/freeberty/RSC_Detector_Firefox.git
   cd RSC_Detector_Firefox
   ```

2. Load the extension in Firefox:
   - Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
   - Select `manifest.json` from the RSC_Detector_Firefox folder

### Permanent Installation
For permanent installation, you can package the extension as an `.xpi` file:
```bash
cd RSC_Detector_Firefox
zip -r rsc-detector.xpi *
```
Then install via `about:addons` > gear icon > "Install Add-on From File..."

## Usage

1. **Automatic Detection**: The extension automatically scans pages as you browse
2. **Manual Probe**: Click the extension icon and use the "Start Fingerprint Probe" button
3. **View Results**: Check the popup for detection results and detailed information

## Technical Details

### Detection Patterns

The extension looks for:

- **Content-Type**: `text/x-component`
- **Global Variables**: `window.__next_f`
- **Library References**: `react-server-dom-webpack`
- **Response Headers**: `Vary: RSC`
- **Protocol Patterns**: React Flight Response format

### Permissions

The extension requires:
- `activeTab` - Access current tab content
- `tabs` - Query tab information
- `webRequest` / `webRequestBlocking` - Modify network requests
- `<all_urls>` - Work on all websites
